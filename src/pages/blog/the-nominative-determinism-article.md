If you're a huge Blaseball nerd, in the past months you may have heard of a 
steady stream of discoveries about the Blaseball sim, despite the fact that 
games aren't going. You may have also heard these discoveries attributed to 
"RNG research", without knowing what that means. It's time we demystified 
one of SIBR's most ambitious and technical projects to date.

## The Sim

To understand RNG research, first you need to know the broad strokes of how the 
Blaseball sim works under the hood. We don't yet understand every minute 
detail, and what we do understand is pretty complex, so this will be a 
simplified approximation.

Every 5 seconds, while games are running, the sim generates the next game 
update for each game[^1].  Sometimes the next event is predetermined. For 
example, the first two will always be "Let's go!" and "Play ball!", a 
batter-up event will always happen after a non-inning-ending plate appearance 
ends, Fax Machine happens automatically if the away team has 10 or more runs in 
a qualifying ballpark, etc. Those events are 100% consistent so the logic 
behind them is easy to solve. Most events, however, have some randomness behind 
them. Figuring out exactly how this randomness translates into game events is 
the goal of the RNG research.

[^1]: After some important events, like a score or a party, there's a longer gap than 5 seconds. Usually it's 10 
seconds but it can be up to 20 (for consumer attacks).

Most of the logic happens as a series of binary (yes-or-no) decisions. For 
example, "does a weather event happen?". If yes, that event becomes a 
weather event (and for most weathers there are more rolls to determine the 
details of the event). If no, the sim goes on to the next question: for each 
baserunner, do they try to steal? If yes, this event is either a Stolen Base or 
a Caught Stealing event (and another roll is used to decide which). If not, it 
moves on to the pitch: is the pitch in the strike zone? Then, does the batter 
swing? If so, do they make contact with the ball? The answers to those rolls 
are used in combination to determine if this is a Ball (no and no), a Strike, 
Looking (yes and no), a Strike, Swinging (either, yes, and no) or contact 
(either, yes, and yes), in which case the sim proceeds to more questions. This 
continues until it has determined what happens in this game event.

Each of these binary decisions is random, and has a certain probability of 
being answered with "yes". Sometimes these probabilities are really low -- 
weather events are very unlikely in Eclipse weather, and a bit more likely in 
Flooding weather (remember, this decision is being made once per game update, 
and the vast majority of game updates aren't Incinerations). Other 
probabilities are pretty high -- an elite pitcher is very likely to get the 
ball in the strike zone. Nearly all the randomness in the sim comes from these 
random decisions with various probabilities. (Almost all the rest comes from 
randomly choosing from a list, like choosing which fielder caught a Flyout.)

There's an easy way for computers to make a decision with unequal probability 
like this. You express your probability as a number between 0 and 1, then you 
generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than your 
probability, the answer is "yes". Otherwise, the answer is "no". When 
we're using this technique we tend to refer to the probability as the 
"threshold".

This is a very common technique, and it wasn't difficult to guess that 
Blaseball would use it. What is difficult is figuring out which checks 
they're making, and after that, how they're computing the thresholds. All 
we can see is the output of this process; without also being able to see the 
input, there's little we can do other than speculate. In this case the 
"input" is the random numbers that were generated, and to get our hands on 
those we'd need to do something wild like break the RNG.

## Breaking the RNG

Computers are actually pretty bad at randomness. After all, a computer is a 
machine that outputs exactly what you tell it to, and the point of randomness 
is that you don't know what it's going to be until you see it. There are 
some neat ways of making a computer measure some randomness from the world and 
convert it into a number, but those tend to be way too slow for a game. So, we 
cheat. We generate numbers that look random, but if you know the algorithm that 
generates them, you can perfectly predict what they're going to be. These are 
called pseudo-random numbers, and the algorithms that generate them are called 
Pseudo-Random Number Generators, or PRNGs. Because programmers are lazy people, 
we often don't say the "pseudo" part and just call them RNGs.

The blaseball RNG (which is called XorShift128+ and is really a PRNG) works the 
way most of them do: you give it an actual random number[^2] to start with, and 
then it generates a new number by scrambling the one you gave it. Then it 
generates the next number by scrambling the previous one, etc. The scrambling 
process performs the same steps each time, but as long as it's a good quality 
scramble you won't be able to notice a pattern and so the numbers will appear 
random. One trick that many PRNGs do, including Blaseball's, is to use more 
digits than you need when they're doing their internal work and then only 
give you some of the digits each time you ask them for a random number. If they 
didn't do this, every time you saw a particular number it would always be 
followed by the same next number. As the name implies, XorShift128+ uses 128 
bits even though a number between 0 and 1 only needs 52 bits[^3].

[^2]: Or a non-random number, if you want to get the same "random" numbers 
    every time you run your program, which can be useful for testing.
[^3]: The reason it needs a strange number like 52 is interesting, and jan 
    Misali has [a good video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQhj5RGtag0).

That paragraph above means that if we can figure out the 128-bit internal state 
of the RNG at any point in time, we can then predict the next number, and the 
next, and so on, forever. All we need is some way to get that state.

Enter [this article][1] (and the [follow-up][2]) by Douglas Goddard. It describes how to 
use a tool called a constraint solver to figure out the state of Chrome's 
internal RNG, which is the same RNG that Blaseball uses. If you can get several 
outputs of the RNG in a row, you can put them into a constraint solver and ask 
it, "what internal RNG state would give us these outputs, in this order?" 
and, if it has enough data, it will tell you. That's really cool! Now all we 
need is a bunch of random numbers between 0 and 1 that the sim generated one 
immediately after another.

![A screenshot of the Blaseball game log showing Tillman Henderson's incineration and replacement with Silvaire Roadhouse.](/blog/the-nominative-determinism-article/tilly-incin-lol.png)

It turns out that when a new player is hatched, from incineration or any other 
source, their attributes are random numbers directly from the RNG. After some 
trial-and-error to figure out the order in which attributes are generated, we 
were able to find the RNG seed for the new egg hatching after an incineration. 
And this RNG can be run in reverse, so we could back up a few rolls and notice 
that there was always a really low number exactly 3 rolls before the first 
attribute value. This was the eclipse weather roll, and it was the first game 
update roll we ever located.

Since then we've figured out a lot more, like how to find random stat changes 
such as parties and shadow boosts. We've also discovered that incinerations 
are connected to each other: if you find one incineration, and then run the RNG 
forwards for a while, you'll get to the next incineration (unless the sim was 
rebooted in the meantime â€” that resets the RNG).

Using the solver to derive the RNG state from player generations let us figure 
out how incinerations work, but it was highly specific to events where a player 
was born or a player had a random[^4] boost or, uh, unboost? Whatever you call 
that. To figure out all the other events we needed another way to find them.

[^4]: "Random" here meaning that each attribute was boosted by a random amount. 
    Most boosts and unboosts do this, but peanuts and blooddrains are always 
    0.2 and 0.1 respectively.

## Help from the Birds

![A screenshot of Reblase showing several Birds messages interleaved with normal game messages](/blog/the-nominative-determinism-article/birsd.png)

We could look forward and backwards from the incineration and boost events to 
get a tiny amount of data, but those were too few and far between to figure out 
how the rolls and the game events related to each other. For that we needed 
something that could happen much more often, yet was still able to be located 
in the RNG stream. Enter: birds.

Bird flavor messages can happen many times per game, sometimes with only a few 
events in between. And, crucially, one of the messages has a random number of 
birds in it. No prizes for guessing where that random number comes from. It's 
not enough data[^5] to solve for the RNG state the way we did for incinerations, 
but it is specific enough that we can start at a known RNG state and scan 
forward until we find one that matches. We also know that this message only 
shows if the "does a weather event happen?" check passed, and that check 
has a pretty low threshold, so there must be a pretty low roll very close 
before. We scanned for this pattern and found the location of two Birds games 
in the Season 3 finals.

[^5]: The technical way to say this is "not enough entropy".

With the location of a birds game, we could then scan around for the signature 
of the other messages[^6]. From there we could find places where only one event 
happened between the two messages, so we knew exactly how long that event was. 
Other times we had to set up equations: If you know that 1 Ball + 2 Strikes, 
Looking = 12 events and 2 Balls + 3 Strikes, Looking = 19 events, you can solve 
it as a system of linear equations. Using this technique, some guess-and-check, 
and a lot of elbow grease we were able to narrow down the durations of most 
event types.

[^6]: The bird messages are picked from a list, and we know how to use a random 
    number to pick a random thing from a list. If we know which item was picked 
    we can work backwards to find out approximately what the random number was. 
    The signature then consists of a low number, for the "does a weather event 
    happen?" roll, followed by a number that chooses the correct message from 
    the list.

## But what do they mean?

We now know which RNG rolls belong to each event, but the next question is: how 
are they used? We can presume that they use the threshold method, but which 
questions are they asking and what are the thresholds they're using?

Well, to answer the first one, you can stare at the numbers very hard. Or, you 
can make graphs! For example, if we only look at Balls and Strikes, Looking, we 
always know whether the pitch was in the strike zone. The first roll is the 
weather check, so let's plot the second roll, with Strikes plotted as blue 
diamonds and Balls as red dots.

![A graph with RNG output ranging from 0 to 1 on the y axis and sample index on the x axis. Strikes, shown as blue diamonds, are concentrated below 0.5 on the y axis and Balls, shown as red dots, are above 0.5. However, the border is very fuzzy and there are strikes as high as 0.9 and balls as low as 0.3.](/blog/the-nominative-determinism-article/ball-v-strike-index.png)

That looks like something! The blue diamonds are mostly towards the bottom, and 
the red dots are mostly towards the top. This is what we in the business call 
~~poggers~~ a correlation. It's far from a clean separation, though. That's 
because the threshold is different every time. A pitcher who's better at 
throwing strikes has a higher threshold than one who's bad at it. Our next 
move is to try to figure out how that threshold works. We're not using the x 
axis for anything useful so let's plot, say, pitcher ruthlessness. And, 
because I'm writing this from the future and I already know how we did it, 
let's exclude every sample where the pitcher or batter has a mod that affects 
attributes.

![A similar graph to before, but now the x axis is pitcher ruthlessness and there is much less overlap between Strikes and Balls. Also, the line separating them is now distinctly diagonal, going up and to the right.](/blog/the-nominative-determinism-article/ball-v-strike-ruth.png)

That's a pretty nice line. Ruthlessness is definitely used to decide whether 
the pitch is inside the strike zone. But it's obviously not the only thing, 
because we don't have our clear separation. At this point we can make guesses 
about what else might be part of the formula, and check them with our plots. Or 
we can use math.

[Support Vector Machines][svm] (SVMs) are a tool for finding an equation[^7] that 
separates a collection of points into two (or more) categories. We have a 
collection of points! And we wish to find an equation that separates them into 
two (or more) categories! We can feed our points into the SVM and tell it all 
the batter's, pitchers, and stadium's attributes, plus the RNG roll, plus 
whether the pitch was inside the strike zone, and it will spit an equation back 
out. Then we can plot the result against our RNG output and see if it's more 
cleanly separated.

[svm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine
[^7]: Technically a hyperplane, which is a math term and not a very fast 
    aircraft.

![A similar graph to the previous two except now strikes and balls are perfectly separated along the diagonal line. The x axis is labeled with this equation: 0.3 + 0.35 * pitcher ruthlessness * (1 + 0.2 * pitcher vibes) + 0.1 * batter musclitude + 0.2 * (ballpark forwardness - 0.5)](/blog/the-nominative-determinism-article/ball-v-strike-svc.png)

Et voila! That's a perfect separation, telling us that the strikes equation 
is that big long one you see as the x-axis label. (It may look ragged along the 
border but that's just the overlap of the dots and diamonds.)

Unfortunately, it's not usually as easy as that. (In fact, it wasn't even 
as easy as that this time. I "forgot" to tell you that I multiplied the 
pitcher's ruthlessness by vibes first, and we put the subtraction of 0.5 from 
forwardness there manually to make the numbers nicer.) SVM can only find 
equations where all the terms are multiplied by some constants and then summed 
up. That's enough for a few of the formulas, but many of them have more 
complicated terms that we have to guess and then feed into the SVM separately. 
That's not even mentioning figuring out the mess of how mods affect 
attributes. It's a lot of work, but at the end of it the SIBR twitter account 
can make tweets like [this][tweet], so it's all worth it. (Also it furthers our 
understanding of Blaseball and ability to make future tools, yadda yadda.)

## A note on timing

This is only possible because we can get the RNG stream and the event stream in 
order. We have the RNG stream, but in order to do our analysis we also need to 
know in which order each game was processed on every tick. That order changes 
randomly in ways that for now appear to be unknowable (because they depend on 
other processes that were running on the same computer as the sim, and we 
don't have visibility into those processes). The only reason this has been 
possible is that the Feed has timestamps that are precise to the millisecond 
and they've proved to be a reliable source for the precise event order. The 
Discipline Era doesn't have the Feed and thus we have no way of finding out 
its precise event order. This means that, for now, we can't perform the 
thorough research on Discipline that we've been doing on expansion. It's 
possible that we could figure something out if we focus on it, but for now our 
research efforts are concentrated on Expansion.

## Discoveries

From this research we've discovered a lot about how the sim works, including 
some of the contents of this article. Research is still ongoing, but there are 
a few highlights:

- Vibes are real. In general, a players attributes are multiplied by (1 + 0.2 * 
vibes), although there are many exceptions where that doesn't apply. This 
means that players at peak vibe are 1 whole star better, and at min vibe are 1 
whole star worse.
- Defense is also real. The sim picks a player on the defending team's lineup 
to act as the defender when one is needed, which includes steal events and, 
surprisingly, home runs in addition to the expected flyout and ground out. But 
â€” and this is why we had such a hard time figuring defense out â€” when it 
needs to display which player caught the out it picks a different random 
player. So the player that it says caught the out is not the player whose 
attributes were used.
- Flinch is rigged. In addition to forcing the player to take a Strike before 
they can start swinging, it also makes the pitchers more likely to throw into 
the strike zone, so those pitches you're forced to take are less likely to be 
Balls. Some of us suspect that this was not in effect in seasons 10 and 11, but 
we haven't analyzed those seasons yet so can't prove anything.
- There's no party attribute. Players like Winnie Hess and Castillo Turner are 
just like that by random chance. This also goes for every other random effect, 
with the caveat that mods like Flickering and Unstable really do increase your 
chance of being hit by a weather event.
- From season 12 to 18, coldness does not appear to have been real. In season 19, 
howeverâ€¦ stay tuned.
- The wave o' babies: Starting in season 7, they started generating a new 
player on every single game update, just in case there was an incineration. If 
there wasn't an incineration that player was just forgotten. There's no 
real reason not to do it this way from a programming perspective â€” making a 
new baby is very cheap â€” but it's bizarre to think about in this light.
